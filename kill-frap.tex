    \todo{Rewrite after body is completed}
    To further the understanding of nucleosome structure and positioning
    in DNA, we aim to measure kinetic differences between wild type and
    mutant histones in live cells. Fluorescent Recovery After Photobleaching
    is a technique successfully used before to show the different kinetics and
    populations between different histone types. Using the same approach with
    our most disrupting histone mutant, we test the limits of FRAP when
    faced with extremely slow exchange ratios.
