\section{Discussion}

    We wished to quantitatively determine the effect on human chromatin stability
    of SIN mutations in core histones H3 and H4 known 
    to be destabilising \textit{in vitro} and to affect cell growth in \textit{S. cerevisiae}.
    We set out to use a previously reported circle FRAP model
    which accounts for multiple errors in a typical FRAP modelling \addref{?}.

    However, FRAP recovery is incomplete even after 8~hours for core histones \citep{KimuraCook}.
    This led us to address a series of technical challenges in
    collecting valid quantiative recovery data over extended time periods.

% Cell movement

    The first problem faced was cell movement.
    This is an expected property of actively dividing cells, 
    so those that are unable to move are likely to be dead.

    We attempted to reduce motion by taking advantage of 
    the fact that many primary cells move into the quiescent \G0{}~phase when they reach high densities. 
    This contact inhibition is a natural mechanism that controls cellular growth in 
    multicellular organisms, and results in a stop to proliferation 
    with formation of a monolayer of healthy cells in tissue culture.

    However, this approach has disadvantages including 
    increased cell handling and reduces transfection efficiency,
    and means that stable cell lines based on immortalised cells cannot be used. 
    The potential inability to compare results with published data for 
    immortalised cell lines such as HeLa is also disadvantageous.

    Despite achieving a monolayer of healthy cells that could be maintained stably over 2 weeks,
    individual transfected primary horse fibroblasts still showed some movement
    despite exhibiting overall characteristics of contact inhibition.
    Furthermore, nuclei in these cells displayed a helical motion on the direction of cell movement \frefp{fig:kill-frap:confluent-horse}.

    The possibility of chemically inhibiting cells to reduce motion was considered
    since previous FRAP experiments with core histones were performed using multiple inhibitors 
    of protein synthesis \citep{KimuraCook}. However, these studies revealed 
    inhibitor-dependent variations in kinetics and the authors qualified 
    their conclusions about the absolute accuracy of exchange parameters measured.

    To better address the problem of cell movement we instead developed a computational approach
    by writing a program for cell tracking by normalised cross-correlation template matching  \addref{?}.
    Using automated analysis enabled us to process the large numbers of cell images 
    required to provide statistically valid quantitative measurements of core histone exchange.

% Compositional changes

    The second challenge to measuring core histone exchage by FRAP is that
    a chemical equilibrium is required between freely diffusing proteins and 
    formation of a complex. Although absolute equilibrium is unlikely 
    in the dynamic cell environment undergoing complex transcriptional and translation responses,
    DNA replication involving polymerase passage and repackaging of the duplicated genome
    in S~phase will clearly unbalance any equilibrium.

    Chromosome compaction in mitosis also generates a chromatin environment
    that is distinct from interphase.
    This limits FRAP experiment to either \G1{} or \G2{} phases.
    The HeLa cell cycle has a typical \G1{} phase of 11.7~hours and a \G2{} phase of 3~hours \citep{HeLaCellCycle}
    so the extended time periods needed for FRAP of core histones requires
    starting FRAP early in \G1{} \frefp{fig:kill-frap:cell-cycle}.

    Post-mitotic chromosomes take approximately 2 hours to migrate within the nucleus 
    and rebuild the interphase nuclear architecture during early \G1{}
    \citep{visualizationG1chromosomes,earlyg1position,RelativeChromosomePosition}.
    This defines the window for extended FRAP experiments from approximately 3 to 11 hours after mitosis
    in HeLa cells, although cells lines with even longer \G1{} phase are known \citep{PancreaticCells}.

    We wished to avoid the use of drugs for cell cycle arrest since this has been
    shown to influence FRAP results \addref{}. 
    We also discounted serum starvation to move cells into the
    quiescent \G0{} phase since this could affect 
    the relevance of measurinng core histone exchange \citep{SerumStarvation} \addref{?}.

      \end{figure}

    Instead, we devloped a procedure to track cells manually during mitosis 
    where visual identification of the cell cycle is possible. 
    This allowed us to minimise interventions and effects on the cell normal growth
    while identifying individual cells exactly 3 hours after start of \G1{}.
    It has the added advantage of allowing time for maturation of GFP 
    expressed during the establishment of interphase.
    The time interval between images during manual selection was increased and 
    both resolution and laser intensity reduced to minimise phototoxicity or bleaching.
    This resulted in a set of selected early \G1{} cells suitable for FRAP experiments.

    The fluorescently tagged histone proteins are constitutively expressed 
    under the control of an EF-1\textalpha{} promoter, 
    so they lack the 3' regulatory features of the native histone genes.
    This regulation does not follow the normal expression program of a histone gene 
    and hence could alter the distribution of the histone in chromatin.
    Constant expression of tagged histones by a strong constitutive promoter
    will enrich them in the \G1{} and early S~phase pools
    making subsequent incorporation in euchromatin more likely,
    relative to mid-late S~phase where heterochromatic sequences 
    are replicated and packaged \citep{DNA-replication-timing}.

    A more realistic tagged histone expression profile can be achieved using 
    flanking regulatory regions from native histone genes,
    as demonstrated for H3 and CENP--A \citep{pMH3-plasmid,Kevin-pCA-TAG}.
    Another potential solution is to insert GFP in-frame into the native gene locus by genome engineering,
    although the redundancy between 18 canonical H2B genes means
    that identifying the most appropriate isoform to target could introduce complexities.

    Protein synthesis inhibitors were used by \cite{KimuraCook} to address this issue,
    but this has the disadvantage of potentially affecting many other processes as discussed above.

% Movement of the reference

    The final challenge to measuring core histone exchange by FRAP that we identified 
    was non-homogenous regional movement of chromatin itself.
    This undermines the assumption of FRAP analysis that binding sites 
    remain immobile throughout the FRAP experiment.
    This assumption is required to interpret recovery
    as the rate of movement of freely diffusing unbleached molecules into the
    bleached area which allows the kinetic rates \Kon{} and \Koff{} to be estimated.
    If chromatin binding sites also move then the recovery curve becomes a 
    much more complex function of both binding site movement and free diffusion.

    Chromatin movement is recognisable both 
    by changes in the intra-nuclear features of the fluorescent chromatin 
    and by changes in the circular bleach spot.
    Although some of these effects are subtle when observed by photobleaching,
    the circle photoactivation by inverse FRAP demonstrates 
    clear non-homogenous reshaping of chromatin.
    Equivalent chromatin movement has also been reported 
    for H4--PAGFP in strip photoactivation \cite{H4PAGFP-chromatin-movement}.

    The movements we observed were in the range of \todo{what sort of dimensions} 
    and exhibited complicated shapes reminiscent of channelling.
    This is consistent with chromosome distribution in nuclei that is 
    territorial on the scale of 5 \textmu m \addref{PMID:10866946} 
    separated by interchromosomal channels of 10-100 nm \addref{PMID:16317046}
    
    The clarity of H2B--GFP imaging in inverse FRAP suggests the opportunity to analyse the 
    paths taken by diffusing core histones. 
    For example, simultaneous use of combined photoactivation and photobleaching 
    of complementary dimer and tetramer histones could 
    enable relative diffusion rates and paths to be determined.
    Alternatively, an enzymatic mechanism to incorporate a 
    complementary photo-differented label into DNA  would facilitate masking for 
    the original location at the same time as tracking the histone diffusion
    and enable quantitative FRAP.
    Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that such experiments would test the 
    resolution and sensitivity of microscopes.

\section{Conclusion}

    Since its inception over 30 years ago, FRAP has been continuously improved
    so teh improved capabilities of light microscopy
    and subtle kinetic models now able to take into account
    an increasing number of biophysical features such as container size, 
    non-homogeneous distribution of fluorescence and profile of bleach spot.

    Despite these advances, the ability to perform FRAP
    over extended time periods of several hours for highly stable complexes
    such as core histones is limited by the dynamic nature of the cell.

    We overcame the challenges of cell mobility and selection of cells in \G1{} phase,
    but were unable to develop a method to adjust for changes in chromatin structure within the cell nucleus.
    While a photobleached spot appears stable and can be tracked over several hours, 
    small natural disturbances impact on photorecovery and estimation of kinetic parameters.
    We find that FRAP is suitable for semi-quantitative estimates of slowly diffusing molecules
    but not for the precise quantitative comparisons required to compare core histone mutations.
