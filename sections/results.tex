\section{Results}

    To investigate the challenges of performing FRAP in mammalian cells over several hours,
    we transfected HeLa cells with a H2B-EGFP under the control of a CMV promoter
    and observed recovery in cells over 8 hours \frefp{fig:kill-frap:cell-movement}.

    \end{figure}

    The images taken at 20 min intervals revealed considerable changes
    in position of the nuclei and arrangement of features within each nucleus, 
    and the shape of the bleach spot \frefp{fig:kill-frap:cell-movement}.
    Initial attempts to quantiatively analyse the images
    did not yield meaningful estimates of H2B exchange kinetics (data not shown).

    The central requirement of FRAP is to accurately identify and 
    quantitate the signal in the photobleached spot over time.
    This led us to pursue both cell biological approaches to minimise movement 
    and computational approaches to track imaged regions.

    %% the aspect ratio of the bleach spot and cell over time 
    %% as an illustration of the changes.

  \subsection{Inhibition of cell motility}

    We first attempted to reduce motility by restricting the space available
    using cells at higher confluency for FRAP experiments.
    This was performed using a HeLa cell line stably expressing 
    the H4~R45H SIN mutant to ensure even H4 fluorescence in all cells.
    It resulted in some decrease in movement of cells
    but did not achieve not a complete immobilisation \frefp{fig:kill-frap:confluent-hela}.
    In fact, nuclei frequently underwent considerable reshaping as cells 
    apparently squeezed between their neighbours.

    %% relative to the first frame as a representative example
    %% for the HeLa cells in the first and second figures.
    %% This needs to be in absolute micron units independent of the magnification.

    %% for a sample of individual cells as a box plot as panel 2C

    Many mammalian primary cells display the property of contact inhibition.
    In this cellular growth response, cells enter senescence and reduce motion
    when surrounded by neighbours \citep{?}.

    Since HeLa cells have lost the ability to activate contact inhibition \citep{?},
    we obtained an immortalised primary horse fibroblast cell line known to display this property.
    Because primary cell line transfections typically have much lower efficiency
    and confluent cells have lower expression with each cell division,
    we transfected cells at \SI{70}{\percent} confluence and performed FRAP after 3 days.

    Despite reaching confluence where contact inhibition was expected, 
    we continued to observe movement of the transfected horse cells \frefp{fig:kill-frap:confluent-horse}.
    The characteristics of cell movement also differ dramatically between primary horse and HeLa cells,
    The horse cell nuclei exhibit a helical motion about the vector of their movement 
    in $x$ and $y$ axes \frefp{fig:kill-frap:confluent-horse}
    whereas HeLa nucelar motion was mostly restricted to the $z$ axis relative to the dish \frefp{fig:kill-frap:cell-movement}.

    \subsection{Image-based tracking of cell movement}

    As an alternative strategy to address movement of the cell nucleus, 
    we implemented a programme to automate cell tracking of time series sequences
    that transformed images into a uniform frame using 
    consecutive image cropping and template-based registration.

    Using this image processing approach we were able to track individual cell nuclei
    throughout an entire sequence of FRAP experiments 
    provided that nuclei did not overlap \frefp{fig:kill-frap:cropreg}.
    Although only a minority of cell image sequences satisfied this requirement
    throughout the full 8~hour duration of observations,
    it was possible to collect a sufficient number of cell observations for FRAP calculations.

  \subsection{Chromatin movement within nuclei}

    While performing the FRAP experiments, we observed some movement of fluorescent chromatin features
    within cell nuclei that was supplementary to the overall motion of the cell itself \frefp{fig:kill-frap:frap-spot-movement}.
    This could not be accounted for by simple rotational movement of nuclei
    as rigid bodies around the $x$ or $y$ axis, 
    and instead appeared to involve movement of individual regions within nuclei .
    Bleach spots also frequently showed elliptical or more complex distortions
    indicative of structural movements in the chromatin \frefp{fig:kill-frap:frap-spot-movement}.

      \label{fig:kill-frap:frap-spot-movement}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Selection of \G1{} cells}

    DNA is replicated and chromatin is repackaged during S~phase,
    suggesting a possible cause for changes in chromatin features that we observed. 
    Furthermore, the doubling of histone content as a result of S~phase breaks
    a core assumption of FRAP that the system remains in equilibrium
    throughout the duration of the experiment.
    This requirement to measure the very slow exchange of core histones
    for a time period of 8~hours limits observations to \G1{}.

    Cells in mitosis were selected and tracked for 4~hours to identify daughter cells
    which had sufficient time to complete post-mitotic chromatin unpacking
    and could be confidently assigned to early \G1{}.

    This selection was challenging because HeLa mitotic cells round up
    as spheres with only a weak connection to the growth surface
    causing them to exit the field of vision.
    Consequently, our screening required a larger number of initial selected cells. 
    Low laser power and an optimised observation interval 
    was used in manual tracking to minimise damage to fluorophores.
    Since our system did not permit simultaneous Z-stack and time lapse imaging, 
    and because cells in mitosis are in a separate focal plane,
    imaging was performed with a maximal pinhole sized focused 
    between the growing and mitotic cell planes.
    The resulting blurred images were sufficient to visualize cells during
    the entire period required for selection.

    Even after carefully selecting cells early \G1{},
    structural movements within the bleach spot could still be observed (data not shown).
\todo{Is there an image sequence showing this bleach spot movement after section?}

%                      can track things fine. Of course, some cells still floated away.}

    \subsection{Chromatin movement observed by inverse FRAP}

    Although we had surmounted the technical challenges of collecting 
    stable images of nuclei over long time periods 
    in \G1{} cells containing stably expressing core histones tagged with fluorescent reporters,
    we were concerned about the non-homogeneity of chromatin behaviour.

    To assess the total extent of the observed movement, we performed inverse FRAP
    to track the movement of the photomodified region alone.
    For this purpose, we fused H2B to photoactivatable GFP (H2B--PAGFP), 
    a GFP derivative that requires activation by a specific wavelength to become fluorescent.
    Since PAGFP cannot be easily detected before photoactivation, 
    cells were co-transfected with mCherry--\textalpha--tubulin 
    which localises exclusively to the cytoplasm 
    and provides an outline of the nuclear region \frefp{fig:kill-frap:ifrap}.

    Considerable non-homogenous movement of chromatin was clearly evident 
    after activating and following PAGFP in \G1{} cells \frefp{fig:kill-frap:ifrap}.
    Instead of homogeneous difussion of fluorescence,
    activated spots uncurled over time with individual channels of
    localized PAGFP appearing in the nuclei \frefp{fig:kill-frap:ifrap}.

    This finding suggests that quantitative FRAP will not be tractable using 
    a simple model based on homogenous non-directional diffusion.
